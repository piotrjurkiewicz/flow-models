In order to be used for benchmarking network mechanisms, models must enable the generation of traffic matching the mixtures. The tool ``generate`` provides a reference for how to properly generate flows from distribution mixtures. It takes a path to the directory containing JSON mixture models as input and outputs flow records. Additionally, a CSV histogram file can be used instead of a mixture model as an input, to generate flows exactly matching the particular dataset.
